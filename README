libcdata - C++ stdlib data structures from C
--------------------------------------------

`libcdata` is a library that exposes _some_ `libstdc++` data structures from a
pure C API.

Example
-------

TODO

Details
-------

The objective is to have an easy to use library for basic day-to-day work of
C applications in user-space.

`libcdata` is NOT meant to be optimal in performance, but "good enough" for most
of the applications. If you have have _true_ performance requirements, you should
consider writing your own custom data structures.

`libcdata`, as `libstdc++`, is not thread-safe.

Requirements
------------

A posix compatible system with:

* Automake
* Autoconf
* Libtool
* libstdc++
